# Nursery Rhyme Lyrics Generator
This script generates random nursery rhyme lyrics by combining phrases from the most popular nursery rhymes.

## Background
As part of our passion project at nurseryrhymes.info, we have been [curating hundreds of nursery rhymes](https://nurseryrhymes.info/a-tisket-a-tasket/). We thought - what if we apply some AI magic to generate new ones off all the data we have collected?

Well, this script is not quite AI magic but it is a basic experiment to see what can be done with some elementary python.

## Usage
To use the script, simply run the script and the lyrics will be printed to the console.

'''
python nursery_rhyme_lyrics_generator.py
'''

## Customization
You can customize the script by adding or removing phrases from the list of popular nursery rhyme phrases. The script uses the random module to select a random number of phrases from the list and join them together to create the lyrics.

## Dependencies
This script requires the random module which is built-in python library, so no additional installation is needed.

## Output
The script will output random nursery rhyme lyrics every time it is run.
